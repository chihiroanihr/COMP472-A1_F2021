Q. In a separate plain text file called bbc-discussion.txt, explain in 1 to 2 paragraphs:
 (a)  what metric is best suited to this dataset/task and why (see step (2))
 (b)  why the performance of steps (8-10) are the same or are different than those of step (7) above.

Answer:
 (a) Recall, precision and F1 measure metrics are best stuited to this dataset since classes are not really equally distributed.
     In other words, one class is more important (has more data) over other classes.
 (b) The performances of steps (8-10) are the same because smoothing technique only handles the problem of zero probability in Na√Øve Bayes
     and thus does not change the actual performances.
